# Librarian
Postman blog post: http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/12/21/librarian-building-a-serverless-slack-app-using-postman-and-airtable/

Librarian is a Postman collection that allows you to use Slack to check the availability of a book in your office library. In this case, we are searching for the book using a Slack app, and also storing the books that we have in the Postman office using Airtable as a database.


# Search in Slack
You can search for your book by typing `/bookbug [book-name]` in Slack. No switching applications or learning a new UI!
